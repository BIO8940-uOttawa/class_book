# Introduction to Rmarkdown

## Practical 

### Context

Let's apply what we have learnt in the course on **Writing dynamic and reproducible documents - An introduction to R Markdown**
 <!-- add link to slides(https:// mysite /intro_rmarkdown/#1).  -->

We will use the awesome `palmerpenguins` dataset `r emo::ji("penguin")`, an alternative to Fisher's `iris` dataset, to explore and visualize data.

These data have been collected and shared by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

The package was built by Drs Allison Horst and Alison Hill, check out the [official website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

The package `palmerpenguins` has two datasets.

```{r showdata-md}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

The dataset `penguins` is a simplified version of the raw data; see `?penguins` for more info:

```{r example-penguins-md}
head(penguins)
```

The other dataset `penguins_raw` has the raw data; see `?penguins_raw` for more info:

```{r example-penguins-raw-md}
head(penguins_raw)
```


For this exercise, we're gonna use the `penguins` dataset.


### Questions

**1)** Install the package `palmerpenguins`.

**2)** Create a new R Markdown document, name it and save it. Delete everything after line 12. Add a new section title, simple text and text in bold font. Compile ("Knit").

**3)** Add a chunk in which you load the `palmerpenguins`. The corresponding line of code should be hidden in the output. Load also the `tidyverse` suite of packages. Modify the defaults to suppress all messages.

**4)** Add another chunk in which you build a table with the 10 first rows of the dataset.

**5)** In a new section, display how many individuals, penguins species and islands we have in the dataset. This info should appear directly in the text, you need to use inline code `r emo::ji("smile")`. Calculate the mean of the (numeric) traits measured on the penguins.

**6)** In another section, entitled 'Graphical exploration', build a figure with 3 superimposed histograms, each one corresponding to the body mass of a species.

**7)** In another section, entitled 'Linear regression', fit a model of bill length as a function of body size (flipper length), body mass and sex. Obtain the output and graphically evaluate the assumptions of the model.

**8)** Add references manually or using `citr` in `RStudio`.

  1. Pick a recent publication from the researcher who shared the data, Dr Kristen Gorman. Import this publication in your favorite references manager (we use Zotero, no hard feeling), and create a bibtex reference that you will add to to the file `mabiblio.bib`.
  2. Add `bibliography: mabiblio.bib` at the beginning of your R Markdown document (YAML).
  3. Cite the reference iin the text using either typing the reference manually or using `citr`. To use `citr`, instal  it first; if everything goes well, you should see it in the pulldown menu `Addins` `r emo::ji("muscle")`. Then simply use `Insert citations` in the pull-down menu `Addins`.
  4. Compile.

**9)** Change the default citation format (Chicago style) into the The American Naturalist format. It can be found here  <https://www.zotero.org/styles>. To do soo, add `csl: the-american-naturalist.csl` in the YAML.

**10)** Build your report in html, pdf and docx format. `r emo::ji("tada")`



### Happy coding
